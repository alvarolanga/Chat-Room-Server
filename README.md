# **Welcome to my Chat Room Implementation**

My motivation behind this project was simple, create a version of Whatsapp using python.
Through this journey I faced some tough challenges such as the implementation on contacts as that delayed a lot of my progress and also figuring out tkinter as it was my first time using the library.
Anyhow, I managed to go thtrough that wall and here I am sharing my Chat Room Idea.

However this project is far from Done, I plan on adding more features such as the personal details of the people listed on the contacts and also a more improved GUI.

I appreciate the time you took to check out my project, follow if you'd like to stay tuned for more.
